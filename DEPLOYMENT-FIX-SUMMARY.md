# Azure Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Container App Environment Quota Issue
**Problem**: The script was trying to create a new Container App Environment, but the subscription already has the maximum allowed (1).

**Solution**: Updated the deployment script to use the existing Container App Environment:
- **Environment**: `az-cae-onox3m7mozzm2` in resource group `rg-dev`
- **Location**: East US

### 2. Container Registry Conflict
**Problem**: The script was trying to create a Container Registry with a name that already exists in a different resource group.

**Solution**: Updated the script to use the existing Container Registry:
- **Registry**: `acronox3m7mozzm2` in resource group `rg-dev`
- **Login Server**: `acronox3m7mozzm2.azurecr.io`

### 3. Resource Group Management
**Problem**: The script was creating new resource groups instead of using existing ones.

**Solution**: Updated the script to use the existing resource group `rg-dev` which contains all the required resources.

## Updated Configuration

The deployment script now uses these existing resources:

```powershell
$RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-dev"
$LOCATION="eastus"
$CONTAINER_APP_ENV="az-cae-onox3m7mozzm2"
$REGISTRY_NAME="acronox3m7mozzm2"
```

## Docker Images Status

âœ… **Built Successfully**:
- `fullstack-auth-frontend:latest`
- `fullstack-auth-backend:latest`

## Deployment Process

1. **Build Docker Images**: âœ… Complete
   ```powershell
   .\build-docker-images.ps1
   ```

2. **Verify Resources**: âœ… Complete
   ```powershell
   .\verify-azure-resources.ps1
   ```

3. **Deploy to Azure**: ðŸš€ In Progress
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-to-azure.ps1
   ```

## Expected Result

The deployment should now:
1. Use the existing Container App Environment (avoiding quota issues)
2. Use the existing Container Registry (avoiding naming conflicts)  
3. Deploy both frontend and backend as Container Apps
4. Provide public URLs for both services

## Additional Files Created

- `verify-azure-resources.ps1` - Verifies all required Azure resources exist
- `build-docker-images.ps1` - Enhanced Docker image building with retry logic
- `DEPLOYMENT-FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

Once deployment completes successfully, you'll get URLs for:
- Frontend application (Nuxt.js)
- Backend API (Next.js)

Both will be accessible via HTTPS through Azure Container Apps ingress.
